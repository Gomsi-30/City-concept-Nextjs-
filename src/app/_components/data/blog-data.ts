      `Buying your first home is an important milestone that requires careful planning and consideration. Here are ten essential steps to guide the process.`,
      `Plan how much money you want to invest: check out your income, expenses, and savings. This will help you plan out your budget.`,
      `Check your credit score: A good credit score will help you get a loan easily and faster. If your credit scores are not good, then taking a loan will be difficult, so first work on your credit score.`,
      `Get your loan approved before time: Before you go house searching, get your loan approved by a bank or finance agent. This will give you a clearer view of your allowance and will make your offer more attractive to owners.`,
      `Research the market: Find areas and neighborhoods that suit your lifestyle and budget. Also keep in mind things like schools, future development infrastructure, etc.`,
      `1a.jpg`,
      `Contact a housing agent: Agents will help you find a house easily and quickly; they will find you a suitable and budget-friendly house.`,
      `Visiting the houses: Schedule and go with the agent to see all the houses he has suggested according to your interest, in choosing a good house.`,
      `1b.jpg`,
      `Booking the house: By negotiating, discussing, and deciding the final price for the house you would like to book with your agent.`,
      `Home Inspection: After you have paid the booking amount, schedule a visit to the house and check all the things and problems in that house. This visit will help you ensure that the value of the agreement matches the property.`,
      `Take insurance: Take homeowners insurance to avoid any fraud and protect your investment from any type of mishap.`,
      `Closing of the deal: Sign the deal with the owner and the agent to avoid future hassle.`,

      `1. Don’t exceed your budget: Calculate your budget beforehand and stick to it to avoid stress in the future. While calculating your budget, keep all the factors in mind, like loan payment, security, insurance, property tax, maintenance, etc., to avoid any difficulties in your financial goals.`,
      `2. Select the right loan: It is very important to research and compare the different home loans available in the market. Factors to consider include the loan rate, processing fee, and repayment terms.`,
      `3. Not getting your mortgage pre-approved: If you don't get your mortgage pre-approved, you won't be able to figure out the exact budget you want to spend, and you won’t be able to attract sellers in a competitive market.`,
      `4. Ignoring your neighborhood: Not analyzing your neighborhood and considering factors like schooling, workplace, safety, and surroundings, while focusing solely on the house, will not be favorable in the long term.`,
      `2a.jpg`,
      `5. Not considering the hidden expenses: Many estate agents do not explain hidden costs like society fees, society maintenance fees, parking fees, and maintenance charges. Not considering these may disrupt your financial plans in the future.`,
      `6. Immediately jumping into a deal closing: Not checking the negotiated terms, reviewing the contract properly, and evaluating alternative options may lead to future stress and regret.`,
      `7. Skipping the paperwork: The government is strict about legal factors. Get all your documents verified by local authorities and contact a legal expert to ensure all work is completed legally.`,
      `2b.jpg`,
      `8. Neglecting future development: Selecting an area where future projects are planned will enhance the valuation of the property as well as improve your lifestyle.`,
      `9. Ignoring the factor of resale value: It’s important to keep this factor in mind as it will help in the future. The resale value is evaluated based on market demand, location, and condition of the property.`,

      `What is a house inspection? House inspection is the process of examining the current condition of the property. It takes place after you have finalized the property. An inspection expert is hired by the buyer to inspect the house components, systems, and structure. This includes inspecting both the inside and outside of the property. After examining the house, they will reveal if the house is well-maintained. If not, they will advise on necessary repairs or replacements. The cost of the home inspection is typically borne by the housebuyer.`,
      `Factors that are determined in a standard inspection: The report made by experts is according to the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors. The following terms are included in the inspection:`,
      `4a.jpg`,
      `Cooling`,
      `Electrical`,
      `Fireplace`,
      `Doors, windows, and interiors`,
      `Attic, insulation, and ventilation`,
      `Basement, foundation, and crawlspace`,
      `Heating`,
      `Roof`,
      `Exterior`,
      `How much does a house inspection cost? The cost of inspection depends on several factors:`,
      `4b.jpg`,
      `Range of cost: The cost usually lies between 5000 to 15000. It depends on the size and complexity of the house. The larger and more complex the house structure, the higher the cost.`,
      `Certification and Experience: More experienced and highly certified inspectors with a high reputation will charge more.`,
      `Geographical location: Costs vary depending on the location of your property. Cities, regions, or metropolitan areas typically have higher rates than rural areas.`,
      `Type of inspection: The cost range depends on the type of inspection being performed. Additional costs may apply for pest, radon, or structural integrity inspections.`,
